//Both inheritance and delegation, promote reuse by way of extending one class from another.

//Delegation is more flexible than inheritance. An object may delegate or pass some of its responsibilities to an instance of another class.
// Different instances of a class may delegate to instances of different classes. Itâ€™s like the way siblings, with the same parents, can and do choose different friends.
//  inheritance - object of a class to be used in place of an object of another class.
// delegation - object of a class to  make use of an object of another class.
// in java a lot of duplicate code
