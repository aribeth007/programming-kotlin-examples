# Functional programming with Lambdas

Imperative Style: what + how

Declarative Style: What, not how

Functional Style: Declarative + higher order functions

Imperative style is familiar, but complex; it’s easier to write, due to our familiarity, but is hard to read.

Functional style is less familiar, but simpler; it’s harder to write, due to our unfamiliarity, but is easier to read.

### Lambda Expressions

A lambda expression is a function with no name whose return type is inferred.

Basic structure

`` { parameter list -> body } ``
